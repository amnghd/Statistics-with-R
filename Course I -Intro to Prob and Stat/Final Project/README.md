# BRFSS-Using-R
This is a statistical exploration in BRFSS (stands for Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) data using R. It was the final project on Duke's Introduction to Probability Course.


These research observations are reached:

Observation 1: People who excersize moderaltely, tend to be more healthy (lower BMI) than people who don’t work out or do excessive excersize.

Observation 2: People tend to feel lethargic (hopeless) when their financial situation doesn’t look good. Women tend to be impacted more in this matter.

Observation 3: People who smoke less, tend to drink less in general. However, less education on drinking behaviour resulted in large population of outliers who are healthy on smoking side, and unhealthy on drinking side.

Observation 4: People who sleep well (around 7 hours) tend to have better health in general. It was shown that these people tend to be more educated, richer, and more active.
